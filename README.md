# CNN-to-classify-images-from-ImageNet
In this project CNN was implemented to classify Corgi dog images from the ImageNet consisting of two different Corgi breeds: Pembroke and Cardigan. Two folders were provided containing training and test data (training_data and testing_data respectively) which each had subfolders containing images of Pembroke corgis and Cardigan corgis. The objective was to design a deep learning model and train the CNN to classify the test data into two image labels with minimum error (high accuracy).
